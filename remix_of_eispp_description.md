This is a remix of previous efforts to create this project.

This mockup is called EISPP, or Enterprise Information System for Peer Production. It is intended to be installed in instances on the web. [1]

Changing from the traditional hierarchical method of organization to a more stigmergic means by sophisticated use of data is not easy. [2]

Ideally, the order could be in the data and not in hierarchies of people which often create roadblocks for innovation and opportunity. [2]

The focus is on peer production, and the observation that open source projects, and really any project, consists of outputs and parts of other projects.
This mockup aims to explore how to merge disparate projects in an effective way and have the contributors of these projects be properly compensated in order to form a functional economy. [1]

Having more sophisticated use of data could show how two people could work together. It could also enable virtual organizations for new projects and initiatives that might someday provide the same sort of output that a corporation would. [2]

Instead of hoarding and protecting intellectual property with patents, sharing [that is amongst projects and individuals] through interconnected value networks may become the norm. Such sharing could be advantageous since the potential interconnectedness could allow value networks producing products to make themselves available to a wider audience than they could reasonably attain by themselves. Renumeration could be obtained by other value networks channelling profits to other connected value networks or through each value network selling their own finished product and keeping all profits to themselves. [3]

for EISPP, we have multiple projects that depend each other. Say the node labeled Project A has edges that link it to other projects that are dependencies.

Maybe I wish to model value going to projects.
If I chose to make a donation to project A [or purchase a product from project A] but also to projects that it directly depends on I have value flowing to project A, but also projects B, C, E, J and H.

I can also have nodes B, C, E, J and H distributing value to their neighboring nodes.

Or their nodes. To what limit? [2]


The future evolution, if EISPP becomes a part of it, might be some sort of hybrid where there exists some hierarchy for some time, or perhaps long periods of time, while new hierarchies form to manage the creation of value in a fair way. If I recall correctly, Bob Haugen developing Value Networks for Sensorica thought that in peer-to-peer production there would still need to be some hierarchy to manage the creation of value. [2]
