The_Semantic_Web
Nature_Inspired_

from TheSemantic_Web_and_Web3_for_Local_First ... "This stimulated research which led to E.I.S.P.P. (1) was for aggregating data together that was
semantically similar as well as most used and hopefully also most geographically and culturally
important. It was also for keeping track of who did what and what changes they made. Questions arise
when migrating this over to the IPFS stack. (2) was for upper ontologies. Questions arise when
considering structural and semantic interoperability. Usually in the Ceramic Network, a schema is
defined but full description logic expressiveness is not available. No reasoning can be done between
terms within a schema and between schemas. Schemas may even lack hierarchical structure like in
taxonomies. OCA is an architecture that to my knowledge does not allow for mappings between
schemas. Project Cambria does, but it may only be structural. What is needed for moving amongst a
fully heterogeneous data space, which would occur in the data for a peer-to-peer economy, is both
semantic and structural mappings. Applied Category Theory could guide how to do this and possibly
this could be expressed in code with LSA or Dragon/Hydra."
(3) is for enhancing data that is in the
system. This could be with the aid of genentic algorithms like in ActiveGenLink, semantic reasoning
using ideas from SwarmLinda, addition of uncertainty as a percentage through fuzzy logic, and
addition of more structured textual data with entity extraction. As the previous work dealt with
location addressed linked data, this would need to be mapped to content-addressable IPFS blocks. At
first glance, this seems to be using the JSON already in blocks and maintaining mutable pointers
between blocks for a larger graph. (4) dealt with entry to the data space and presentation of it.
PowerAqua uses an inverse document index, ontology index, and mapping between the document and
ontology index to guide natural language queries which take advantage of structured data with
semantics. E.I.S.P.P. considered having RDF data and ontologies used returned by PowerAqua. Then
the RDF linked data and ontologies were seen as a bootstrap to SPARQL queries for more RDF data,
further queries using the structure of the ontologies for more RDF linked data, and for “follow your
nose” graph traversal for more RDF linked data. To make the linked data and have RESTful retrieval of
chunks that are usful for application building the Linked Data Platform which was used to inspire the
SOLID Project was added. To make this more Web3+, again mappings to content-addressable schemes
from RDF would need to be considered. Also GraphQL and a relation of GraphQL and SPARQL made
through GraphQL-LD seems important due to the wide adoption of GraphQL through the Graph. For
Restful retrieval of content-addressable data, Mauve’s IPLD URL work could be considered."

"(5)
considered the structures recording who worked, how people worked, and how much their work was
worth. More modern reward schemes from Web3 as well as money streaming may need to be
considered. (6) E.I.S.P.P. drew on access control lists location addressed identifiers for people and
angents. In a web3+ world decentralized identifiers and accessing schemes that are self-contained and
granular on function rather than by group or agent. Verifiable credentials could be useful for
determining the whether agents holding certain attestations are allowed to utilize a particular resource.
(7) secure data transfer channels were not considered for E.I.S.P.P, nor was a means to look at
computing for the agents in an IPFS centric way."

I was looking at something I wrote last year, for a proposal to Causal Islands Toronto, and it caused me to zoom out a bit:
The_Semantic_Web

from TheSemantic_Web_and_Web3_for_Local_First ... "This stimulated research which led to E.I.S.P.P. (1) was for aggregating data together that was
semantically similar as well as most used and hopefully also most geographically and culturally
